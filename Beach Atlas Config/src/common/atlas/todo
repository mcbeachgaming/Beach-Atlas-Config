need to create a new method to allow for only processing the ip and port information
update the saving of the json, so that the new file will be fileName_modified.json
in the same directory as the current json being used, add this text to the text area
fix the transient nodes, files, etc

1.3 work in progress
Create a pre-start checklist for the ServerGrid official, transient nodes, etc.  Disable checkboxes where it is not available.
write the transient nodes, discovery names in the program itself, create the files if not found.
File chooser to determine where to save the json, with a user specified name



v1.2

Added:
Discovery zones for powerstone islands, pulled from official.
Discovery zones for trenches, pulled from official.  
Discovery zones for kraken, pulled from official.
RCON is set in additionalcmdparams


Changed:
Changed the template to update like Template Name Grid i.e Western Tropical C1
Disabled functions that currently don't work because of a github issue.
Updated the informational area to display the correct things.

Fixed:
The template renamer was overwriting existing values.
Files not being overwritten will be saved in the same directory as the specified json


What does this tool try to accomplish?
It automates the copy and pasting of the quest icons for the powerstones, essences
kraken, ghost ship.(Typically called globalgameplaysetup)  It also adds the static discovery zones for these as well.
It can also add discovery zone names to the json, so when approaching an island you will not have a blank discovery popup.
It can also set the network ports/ip address
